# Challenger

One of the benefits to linking and tracking `ModelCards` along with various `experimentcard` metrics is that it's relatively easy to compare different model versions via the `ModelChallenger` class.

## Examples

For examples please refer to `examples/challenger` for examples on how to compare registered model and un-registered models.
