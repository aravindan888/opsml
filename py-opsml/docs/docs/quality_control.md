## **What is Quality Control?**

Quality control in the context of `OpsML` refers to:

### Developer-First Experience
- **Zero-friction Integration**: Drop into existing ML workflows in minutes
- **Type-safe and efficient by Design**: Rust in the back, python in the front<sup>*</sup>. Catch errors before they hit production
- **Unified API**: One consistent interface for all ML frameworks
- **Environment Parity**: Same experience from development to production
- **Dependency Overhead**: One dependency for all ML artifact management

### Built to Scale
- **Trading Cards for ML**: Manage ML artifacts like trading cards - collect, organize, share
- **Cloud-Ready**: Native support for AWS, GCP, Azure
- **Database Agnostic**: Support for SQLite, MySQL, Postgres
- **Modular Design**: Use what you need, leave what you don't

### Production Ready
- **High-Performance Server**: Built in Rust for speed, reliability and concurrency
- **Built-in Security**: Authentication and encryption out of the box
- **Audit-Ready**: Complete artifact lineage and versioning
- **Standardized Governance Workflows**: Consistent patterns to use across teams
- **Built-in Monitoring**: Integrated with Scouter

<sup>
*OpsML is written in Rust and is exposed via a Python API built with PyO3.
